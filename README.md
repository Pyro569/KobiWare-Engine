# KobiWare-Engine-Plus-Plus
This is like my twentieth time redoing the KobiWare Engine, just this time in C++  
# How to Use  
There is not much to the KobiWare Engine at the moment and it is mostly useless, however to implement it and use it you must download the "KobiWare Engine.h" file and include it within your C++ header  
Current functions of the KobiWare Engine Include:  
  -createWindow(int width, int height, char* name, int fScreen)  
  -drawLine(int r, int g, int b, int size, int x, int y)  
  -clear
  -inputCase(int xIncr, int yIncr)
   
# Example Usage  
As the engine matures I will create more examples of its usage via games, the current inclusion is "Snake" but its not really snake and is kind of bad but hopefully will get better over time.
